npm run start
```

> uses parcel to bundle the project and deliver via dev server.

## **Features**

- Geometry - explore different geometric shapes, custom meshes, and geometry manipulation techniques.
- Materials - experiment with various materials, textures, shaders, and material properties to achieve different visual effects.
- Models - load and display 3D models in different formats (e.g., OBJ, glTF) and interact with them in the scene.
- Lights - learn about different types of lights (e.g., directional, point, ambient) and how they affect the scene's illumination.
- Cameras - understand camera properties, perspectives, controls, and interactions within a Three.js scene.
- Effects - discover post-processing effects (e.g., bloom, blur) and particle effects to enhance the visual experience.
- Helpers - utilize helper utilities such as gizmos, widgets, and scene management tools to aid in development and debugging.

## **Navigation**

You can navigate between different demos and experiments using the navigation menu provided in the user interface. Each item in the menu represents a specific topic or demo, allowing you to quickly switch between them and explore different features of Three.js.
